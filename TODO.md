# TODO: Update Landing Page

## Tasks
- [x] Edit +layout.svelte: Remove "made with lots of ☕️" text, remove theme toggle button, and remove bottom <Social /> component to reduce height and eliminate scrolling.
- [x] Edit Footer.svelte: Remove "made with lots of ☕️" text.
- [x] Edit +page.svelte: Add smooth scroll functionality to the down-arrow icon to jump to the next section (e.g., scroll to bottom or specific element).
- [x] Test changes by running the site locally to ensure no scrolling is needed and down-arrow works.
- [x] Adjust page size: Change min-h-screen to h-screen in +page.svelte, remove py-12 from slot div in +layout.svelte to prevent scrolling on landing page.
- [x] Change down-arrow to navigate to /about page instead of scrolling.
- [ ] Test updated changes locally.
